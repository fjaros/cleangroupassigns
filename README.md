- Arrangements can be made by dragging players from the player bank to each group. They can be then saved for later use. 
- **NOTE:** Rearranging a raid is not possible in combat. Blizzard specifically blocks add-ons from doing this and there is no legal way to bypass it.



- Fetch Arrangements will download presets from the raid leader and other raid assistants using the addon.
- Show Only Players In Raid will limit the player bank to only show players in the current raid group.
- Copy Current Raid discards the current arrangement if unsaved, replacing it with the current raid arrangement.
- Invite Roster To Raid will attempt to invite all the players in your current arrangement.
- Import Roster enables pasting in players from docs or spreadsheets separated by commas or spaces. Thanks to tobbi007 for helping with this contribution!
- REARRANGE RAID will change the groups to reflect your setup.
- Delete arrangements and players from player bank via right click.
