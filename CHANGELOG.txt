- Import Roster enables pasting in players from docs or spreadsheets separated by commas or spaces.
  Users can import either in the view of the group window:
  Player1, Player6
  Player2, Player7
  Player3, Player8
  Player4, Player9
  Player5, Player10

  Player11, Player12
  ...

  Or they can paste a separated list such as Player1, Player2, Player3,...
